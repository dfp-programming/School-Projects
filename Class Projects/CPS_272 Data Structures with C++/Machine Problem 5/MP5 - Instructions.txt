    Insert the words into a binary search tree (BST), T1.
    Do a postorder traversal of the tree T1 nodes and print them, then insert them into a new BST: T2.
    Do a preorder traversal of the tree T2 and print it, then insert them into T3.
    Do an inorder traversal of the tree T3 and print it.
    Print the heights and the number of leafs in each of the three binary search trees.

Please upload the following:
